# NumberGuessingGameAndroid

Hi, my name is YiÄŸit EFE.

I created this number guessing game (I don't know if this is a real game or not, my friends taught me to play it) using Android Studio in Java.

The rules are pretty simple and also explained in the app.

Once you start the game, a number which you can not see will be generated, and you will try to guess this number.

-You have 10 guesses.
-You can not guess a number that starts with a zero.
-Your guess must be a number that has unique digits.
-If you guess both the number and it's place correctly, you will get a plus count as a result.
-If you guess the number correctly but not in the right place, you will get a minus count as a result.
-If you guess both the number and it's place incorrectly, you will not get a result.

Your previous guesses and their results will be displayed on the screen for you to make a better guess next time.

For a better explanation, I will put two game screenshots below:

Hope you enjoy the game!
